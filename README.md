> A 2-axis robotic arm built with a Raspberry Pi Pico and controlled in real-time from a host computer.

This project serves as a foundational project in embedded systems, demonstrating a professional host-client architecture, object-oriented programming for hardware control, and a stateful, non-blocking control loop. The chassis is also built around LEGO bricks, a choice that highlights creative prototyping by leveraging common materials to overcome equipment constraints.

## ‚úÖ Features

-   **Real-Time Control:** A non-blocking input loop allows for instant, responsive control by sending single-keystroke commands from the host PC.
-   **Object-Oriented Design:** A reusable `Servo` class provides a high-level API to control the motors, abstracting away low-level PWM signal generation.
-   **Host-Client Architecture:** A Python script on a PC acts as the host, sending commands over a serial interface to the Pico client, which runs the firmware.
-   **Stateful Control:** The firmware tracks the current angle of each joint, enabling both incremental movement and an automated homing sequence on startup.

## üíª Software & Architecture

The system is split into three main files, representing a clean separation of concerns.

-   `servo.py`: A MicroPython library that defines the `Servo` class. This blueprint handles all the low-level PWM signal generation and angle-to-duty-cycle calculations.
-   `main.py`: The firmware that runs on the Raspberry Pi Pico. It initializes the servos, runs an auto-homing sequence on boot, and enters
